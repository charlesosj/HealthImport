Python scripts to import samsung and withings data export csv into postgreSQL tables

Use the sql schemas to create your tables and rename as you wish

A hash is generated as we dont have a unique id , we can use that to not have duplicates everytime you import

Update your DB connections at the start of each page.. 

I only did the scripts i needed, so feel free to add your own to this repo
